# Summary
AI World 2016 was a great conference - at least from my perspective one of the mosst imformative I have attended in years. Whether from bots, to security applications, business strategy need to move:
- AI is the new user interface
- Bots are the new apps
- From "mobile-first" to "AI-first"


# Artificial Intelligence as Distruptor

One of the most memorable moments in the AI World conference for me was when a [cartoon](https://goo.gl/images/hfQGz2) image (drawn by Chris Madden) was shown which declared, "The good news, Dave, is that the computer's passed the Turing Test. The bad news is that you've' failed."  

The day of AI is upon us. Of course Siri, Google, Alexa, Cortana, and Samsung's newly acquired Bixby are the tools that come to mind. Already much better than when initially released, they are increasingly able to address a wide variety of natural language questions today. Pick 20 questions at random, and there's a finite probability they'll' get it right.  

Interfaces have proven to be technology distruptors, and AI is no different. The tranistion from the typewriter to the PC caused a precipitous drop in typewriter sales. The transition to email and electronic documents led to the current y/y decline in surface mail volume. The smartphone revolution has caused PC sales to stagnate. The question is, what markets and job-roles will be disrupted by AI? Will the job of radiologist (one who interprets x-rays) really be obsolete in five years, as one presenter speculated?

# Bots

What\'s astounding is that capablities behind these tools are now within reach of the "regular" enterprise. In fact, if you're not already deploying some form of AI, you're behind. Intelligent bots reviewed in a special conference session showed tremedous progress. You can get your own demo account at [API.AI](https://api.ai/) and play around. The design of the programming interface follows the natural flow:

<h3>NLP  --> "Intent" --> "Concepts" --> "Entities" --> "Fulfillment"</h3>


I recommend you sign up for a demo account and then head straight over to training. With just a few keystrokes you'll have your own AI bot (though meaningful training takes much more).


# "Big Data"

Kogentix co-founder Boyd Davis emphasized the need for "data collection at scale". 

Moore's law has made computing resources available at scale and at low coast. Open source software, such as  Linux, has made software available and affordable. And hardware initiatives, like the [Open Compute Project](http://www.opencompute.org/) have improved platform performance and reduced costs for scale deployment. 


AI relies on Machine learning to train algorithms for data reduction and predictions. "This call may be recorded" on a help line likely means more data for an AI to train itself in how to respond to customer needs. The cosst of this analysis was We can leverage the massive parallel compute capability of Apache Hadoop, storage substrates, Spark for analytics, and SQL interfaces. The role of Kogentix and Cloudera big data solutions are to knit that all together into an open and accessible platform for AI.


# Business ROI

At today's cost, AI is more accessible than ever. The current threshold, within wide margins, is that if you have 10 people doing 30% repetitive work, the job is a candidate for AI. Prototypes can be developed quickly and tested, but the real challenge is operationalizing. The greater diversity of data means more exposure of untested corner cases, for example. The compatition between AI solutions is not is speed of deployment. For AI to be believable. For AI not to lose or irritate customers, the competition needs to be on the quality of the solution.

# Success Depends on Data, ML, and HITL

As [Crowdflower](https://www.crowdflower.com/) CEO Robin Bordoli highlighted, you need to pay attention to the full development cycle to deliver the highest quality AI solution. This starts with the training data. As I've emphasized in some of my blogs, the quantity of training data (both in numbers and in quality) plays a strong role in model accuracy and resiliency. The next step is carefully chosen ML algorithms. And the final step, which I agree is also essential, is what he called "Human in the Loop" (HITL) especially as alorithms are first brough on line, having people both checking results, and being available for seemless escalation of customer concerns in case the algorithm can't decipher the proper intent or concepts, is essential. 

# AI for everyone
 
While big iron, fancy algorithms, and slick implementatations of AI seem to attract most of the press, there is a huge market at lower price points for AI tools. This is an example of the "train in the cloud, model on the device" approach advocated by most of the attendees. This has been enabled by the growin gcapability of the computing chips in all our devices. 

A cool example of this "AI for everyone" was the robot ATHENA. It's an AI assistant based on a hacked Roomba for mobility, and a table computer for human interface. It's capable of simple but important autonomous tasks, such as guiding a person form one point to another in an office environment. When I saw this demonstrated, I immediately imagined the utility in a doctor's office. As things currently stand, a nurse generally guides me from the front office to an exam room, where the patient degowns, etc while the nurse waits patiently outside. Guiding someone around an office is a low value task that, in principle, ties-up the nursing staff from doing more "high value" activities such as spending time with patients. This is exactly what AI should do - free us up for more important work. 

Here's a short video clip for your entertainment...

# Summary

AI is exploding. Many of the conferees spoke of the AI-desert, the period of time starting in the 1970's, when the promises of AI made mathematical-sense, but could not be supported in practice. The cloud computing revolution, with ready access to powerful handsets than can support local prediciton model computation, and cloud computing data centers, which can support the massive computations necessary to develop and fit the models to huge amounts of data, have made the difference. It really is "AI-first".
