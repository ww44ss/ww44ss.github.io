### Exascalar  
Exascalar is a way to look at both the performance (as measured in Mflops by the [Top 500 Supercomputer List](http://www.top500.org)) and the efficiency (as measured in Mflops/kW by the [Green 500 Supercomputer List](http://www.green500.org) in the same analysis.  A [taxonomy of Exascalar](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/01/28/the-taxonomy-of-exascalar/) highlights several key points of the graph. 

### Link to analysis

The [june 2015 analysis](https://rpubs.com/ww44ss/Jun2015Exascalar) shows little changed in the very top of hte list, but several key innovations are worth keeping an eye on.
