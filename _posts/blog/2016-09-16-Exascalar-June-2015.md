# Exascalar  
Exascalar is a way to look at both the performance (as measured in Mflops by the [Top 500 Supercomputer List](http://www.top500.org)) and the efficiency (as measured in Mflops/kW by the [Green 500 Supercomputer List](http://www.green500.org) in the same analysis.  A [taxonomy of Exascalar](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2013/01/28/the-taxonomy-of-exascalar/) highlights several key points of the graph.

The [june 2015 analysis](https://rpubs.com/ww44ss/Jun2015Exascalar) shows little changed in the very top of hte list, but several key innovations are worth keeping an eye on. 

# June 15 2016 Results

The Exascalar graph shows little progress in the top of the June 2016 Edition of the Top500 list, but Exascalar does reveal some changes worth paying attention to. To emphasize these changes, the new and old list are superimposed.

As mentioned, the top system did not change. However, looking at the lower right of the graph, some new, very high efficiency, systems make an appearance. This is usually how dramatic changes in the list begin, as with the IBM systems in years past. Efficiency and capabliyt are first demonstrated, and with proper financing, a larger scale system is then capable of delivering, all other things being equal, much higher performance withing the same power envelope. 

It will be interesting to see how this vision transpires.
