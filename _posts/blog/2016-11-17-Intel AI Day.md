# Summary
After attending Intel's AI I'm much more confident they finally understand the importance of the transformation: AI us the new UI & Data is the new infrastructure.'

# Overall Themes

The main presentations of Intel AI were made by it's leading executives, CEO Brian Krzanich, Diane Bryant, Doug Davis and 

Brian Krzanich kicked off the day with a talk on Intel's overall vision for AI, which he stated was "pervasive" and how "Intel will be a catalyst" in the future for AI innovation. The rest of the day emphasized key points of his talk. However, I found his speaking points unconvincing overall. Not necessarily that what he had to say was wrong, but it felt like hearing him repeat phrases like "Data connectivity and Analytics." 


Although Intel is late to the AI table (it seems like ancient history, but [Apple moved it's Siri voice recognition system](https://backchannel.com/an-exclusive-look-at-how-ai-and-machine-learning-work-at-apple-8dbfb131932b#.ub715w3o8) from a simple Markov model to a neural network model over two years ago), I think Intel finally gets it. Interfaces drive changes in technology. When the UI went from keys and paper to keystrokes and monitors, the PC revolution happened. AI is the new UI that will shift us in profound ways to new usages and technologies. 

Intel doesn't intend to miss out.

# Intel's Deep Learning Problem

Deep Learning is at the peak of the machine-learning hype-cycle right now, so we need to take everything said about it with a grain of salt. Intel has been getting clobbered in the Deep Learning by both NVidia, which makes the GPUs that are the favored high performance tool for neural networks, and by companies like Google, who have opted to build their own optimized solutions, such as Tensor-flow.

Nevertheless, the beast is awakened. Intel's intention is to "run all wokrloads best on IA", including "AI in IA."

# The Nervana response

Intel's recently-announced acquisition of Nervana seems like a smart move. As the [cadence for silicon technology lengthens](https://www.engadget.com/2016/03/23/intel-eliminating-tick-tock-moores-law/), improvements in workload performance will increasingly be made architecturally, that is, through changes to the underlying silicon design and instruction-set.

From this perspective, the Nervana solution looks very interesting. Basically gates optimized to handle the massive matrix calculations necessary for supervised learning of neural networks, the sollution could offer signiticant performance enahncements. 

To be honest, although strong performance claims were made ("Best in Class Neural Network Performance"), the claim carried the footnote "Rstuls have been estimated or simulated using internal Intel analysis." So while Intel's modeling capability is second to none, it means we'll have to wait a while to see the results. And in this field, a lot can change. 

# Xeon and Xeon Phi

According to Diane Bryant 80% of the new flops on the recent Top500 Supercomputer list were done on Xeon Phi. if tru that's an impressive number. Of course, the Top500 list doesn't change super fast, with

# Intel and Software



# Their Strategy?
Intel's main business strategy has always been to win on performance. You don't need to model too deeply to understand that you only need to buy half the computer if your computer can run twice as fast. 


# Can Intel Win?
