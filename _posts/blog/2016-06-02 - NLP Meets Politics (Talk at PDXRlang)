### NLP meets Politics: Word Vectors meet Campaign Debate Rhetoric
This Spring I did some work looking at similarities and differences of candidate speech for the 2016 presdential elections and presented some of the results at the [PDXRlang](http://www.pdxrlang.org) R language user group.

A link to the abstract is [here](http://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/events/229130207/)

### A brief note on methods
The analysis focused on the 2015 debates of the republican and democratic parties. I got the text from the UCSB Presidency Project. Rather than machine read from teh website, I found it easier just to cut the text and store it locally on my drive.

Analysis was done in R.

### Link to analysis

I published some of the analysis on rpubs. Below is a list:

[Heat Maps](https://rpubs.com/ww44ss/debateheatmap). One of the more useful tools, this allowed easy visualization of the candidate speech. It was especially useful when dissecting the debates for specific topics.

[Word Clouds](https://rpubs.com/ww44ss/Debate_Text). This uncovered something interesting. Looking at the very simple "word clouds" of there was a surprising similarity between the word choices of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. Such close similiarities did not carry over to other candidates. It's interesting that, while they are on opposite ends of the political spectrum, the words they use to wrap their populist message in are similar. Perhaps this is part of their appeal?
