I'm an experienced scientist and technology executive with a background in fundamental science, data science, information security, data center infrastructre, organziation leadership, and business strategy. My current interests build on this experience for rigorous, data-driven, and context relevant insights into the meaning(s) of data. 

## Interests 
Some current projects of interest in data science, machine learning, and data visualization.
o _Data Visualization_ for insights into data stories.
    - Campaign Debate Speech.
    - Supercomputing "Exascalar"
o _Machine learning_ for prediction and detection capabilities. 
    - Privacy implications of OkCupid data.
    - Fraud detection in ski-pass usage.
    - Road-safety twitter-bot.
o _Data Science_ for rigor and reproducible methods.
    - Published raw data, code, and results.

 
## Professional Background 
For most of my career I worked at Intel Corporation, where I held a wide variety of technical, management, and leadership positions. These included anagement of large engineering groups and smaller "high-level IC" teams." I have a wide array of technical experience, including wafer-processing technology development, product development, data center cooling technology, and fundamental physics. Business relationships included supplier management, product-development, and industry-consortium leadership. My most recent experience was in security and encryption technology development and secure product-development lifecycle management.  

## Education  
Ph.D in Physics at UC Berkeley. Postdoctoral research at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) and Caltech.
