I’m an experienced scientist and technology professional with a background in information security, data center technologies, customer support, business strategy, and program, project, and organization management. 
  
### Current Interests 
My current interest is in data science, machine learning, and data visualization.  
- _Data Visualization_ for the insights it provides.   
- _Machine learning_ for its prediction and detection capabilities.   
- _Data Science_ for the rigor of reproducible methods and testable hypotheses.   

I completed the [Coursera Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) certification and have since pursued independent data science research. Topics include Natural Language Processing, fraud detection, traffic safety analytics, mapping and geo-spatial analysis, and data visualization. 

### Professional Background 
For most of my industrial career I worked at Intel Corporation, where I held a wide variety of technical, management, and leadership positions. Experience included: wafer-processing technology development, supplier management, product-development, data center and computing technology development, industry-consortium leadership, security and encryption technology development, and secure product-development lifecycle management.  

### Education  
I completed a Ph.D in Physics at UC Berkeley and did postdoctoral research at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) and Caltech before joining Intel.
