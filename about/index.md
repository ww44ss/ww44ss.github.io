I’m as passionate about data science as I am about skiing, cycling, and mountains. An experienced scientist and technology professional, my background includes data analytics, information security, data center technologies, customer support, business strategy, and program, project, and organization management.  
 
### Current Interests 
My current interest is in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. I’ve had a long interest in divining truth from data. Having completed the [Coursera Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) certification, I have since pursued independent data science research. Topics include Natural Language Processing, fraud detection, traffic safety analytics, mapping and geo-spatial analysis, and data visualization. 


### Professional Background 
I have a wide variety of technical, management, and leadership experience including: wafer-processing technology development, supplier management, silicon product-development, data center and computing energy efficiency technology development, industry-consortium leadership, security and encryption technology development, and secure product-development lifecycle management.  


### Education  
My Ph.D research at Berkeley was on the physics and quantum-mechanical properties of nano-materials. I did postdoctoral research at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) and Caltech.
