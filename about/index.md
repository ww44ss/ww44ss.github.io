I’m an experienced scientist and technology professional with a background in information security, data center technologies, business strategy, management, and data analytics.
 
__Educational Background__  
My Ph.D research at Berkeley was on the physics and quantum-mechanical properties of nano-materials. I did postdoctoral research at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) and Caltech. 

__Professional Background__  
From 1993, until I retired in 2016, I fulfilled a wide variety of professional roles at Intel, ranging from wafer processing technology to supplier management, product development, data center and computing energy efficiency, information security, and secure product-development lifecycle management.  

__Current Interests__  
My current passion is for data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Having completed the [Coursera Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) curriculum in 2015 I have independently pursued interests in data science including Natural Language Processing, fraud detection, mapping and geo-spatial analysis, and data visualization.
