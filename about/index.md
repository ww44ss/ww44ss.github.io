I’m an experienced scientist and technology professional with a background in information security, data center technologies, business strategy, management, and data analytics.
 
### Current Interests 
My current passion is for data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Having completed the [Coursera Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) certification in 2015, I have since pursued independent pursued data science research. Topics include Natural Language Processing, fraud detection, traffic safety, mapping and geo-spatial analysis, and data visualization. 


### Professional Background 
I have a wide variety of technical, management, and leadership experience including: wafer-processing technology to supplier management, silicon product-development, data center and computing energy efficiency, industry-group leadership, security and encryption technologies, and secure product-development lifecycle management.  


### Education  
My Ph.D research at Berkeley was on the physics and quantum-mechanical properties of nano-materials. I did postdoctoral research at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (Switzerland) and Caltech.
